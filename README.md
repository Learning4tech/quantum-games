# Quops Game

**Quops** is a web-based board game inspired by quantum mechanics, where two players take turns manipulating tiles to reach a specific game state. This version is built using Python (Flask) for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 board.
2. Player 1 and Player 2 alternate turns.
3. On each turn, a player can place their mark ("Player 1" or "Player 2") in an empty cell.
4. A cell can only be filled once.
5. The objective of the game is to follow the predefined quantum operations to manipulate the board and win the game (rules will depend on the specific quantum mechanics logic).

## How to Play

1. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
